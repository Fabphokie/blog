            </h1>
            <h3>
                Growing up in Rustenburg, I was always intrigued by computers and technology and I went to  a technical High School where I fell inlove with Electrical Engineering.
                That curiosity led me to explore coding, and I began my journey at CodeSpace Academy under the Royal Impact sponsorship as one of the first Cohort for BCL. <br />
                <br />

                At CodeSpace, I delved into the world of programming, learning the fundamentals of coding languages like JavaScript. It was an exciting time of discovery, where each lesson brought me closer to understanding the inner workings of software development.

                As I honed my skills at CodeSpace, I realized that coding wasn't just about typing lines of text—it was about problem-solving, creativity, and bringing ideas to life. With every project completed and every challenge overcome, my passion for software development grew stronger.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now, armed with the knowledge and experience gained from CodeSpace Academy, I'm proud to call myself a software developer. It's a title that represents not only my technical abilities but also my determination to pursue my dreams in the ever-changing landscape of technology.
                <br />
                <br />
                But who am I, amidst this sea of ones and zeros? I am the digital alchemist, turning ideas into reality with the wave of my keyboard. My name is Mmaphokeng, and this is my journey—a saga of triumphs and tribulations, of bugs conquered and algorithms perfected.
                Join me as I reflect on my journey from CodeSpace Academy to where I am today—a software developer ready to make a difference in the world, one line of code at a time.
